# projectLive_demo
This repo houses demo projectLive apps for different groups

# Develop Branch
This is the original branch with the V1.0 of projectLive in NF.

# Demos
- Any new demos for particular groups should be started as new branches with the name "demo_<group_name>"
- The branch should stay live until the demo is complete 
- The branch Readme should clearly state the scope of the demo app, name of the person who requested the demo, and any other salient details.

### demo_INCLUDE_new
